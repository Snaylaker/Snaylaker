I'm Mehdi, a full-stack developer based in Paris.

I work mostly with TypeScript and React to build full-stack web applications. On the side, I've picked up Neovim with Kickstart and have been learning some Golang.

I come from an embedded systems background where I played with C, C++, Python I also worked professionaly with Java Springboot. 

Most of my projects are just me following my curiosity and trying to grasp new concepts, so don't expect anything polished and if you have any questions, i will be glad to have a chat.
