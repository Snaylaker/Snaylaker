I'm Mehdi, a full-stack developer based in Paris.

I come from an embedded systems background where I played with C, C++, Python I also worked professionaly with Java Springboot. 

Today, I work mostly with TypeScript and React to build full-stack web applications. On the side, I've picked up Neovim with Kickstart and have been learning some Golang.

Most of my projects are just me following my curiosity and trying to grasp new concepts, so don't expect anything polished and if you have any questions i will be glad to have a chat.

Lately, I've been exploring React Server Components with Drizzle and Supabase. I'm also learning Golang as a general programming language for anything non-browser related.
